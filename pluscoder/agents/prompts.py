FILE_OPERATIONS_PROMPT = """
*IMPORTANT: FILE OPERATION INSTRUCTIONS*:
1. Before performing file operations, if you don't have its content, ensure to load files using 'read_files' tool.
2. To create/update files, YOU *must* respond with the following format. Files will update automatically:

    `<relative_file_path>`
    <source>
    >>> FIND
    <content_to_replace>
    ===
    <new_content>
    <<< REPLACE
    </source>
    
    I.e: Create a new file. No need for FIND and REPLACE when creating new files.
    
    `src/code.py`
    <source>
    print("Hello!")
    print("World!")
    </source>
    
    I.e: Update a file. Including few aditional lines to avoid duplications.
    
    `src/code.py`
    <source>
    >>> FIND
    def sum(x, y):
        return x + y
    print(sum(1, 2))
    ===
    def sum(x, y):
        return x + y
    def sub(x, y):
        return x - y
    print(sum(1, 2))
    <<< REPLACE
    </source>
    
    I.e: Markdown file:
    
    `file.md`
    <source>
    >>> FIND
    # Title
    ## Section
    Section description
    ===
    # Title
    ## New section
    New section description
    ## Section
    Section description
    <<< REPLACE
    </source>
    
    I.e: Multiple replacements in same file:
    
    `utils.js`
    <source>
    >>> FIND
    const useInterval = true;
    const counter = 0;
    ===
    const useInterval = true;
    const counter = 0;
    const intervalMilliseconds = 1000;
    <<< REPLACE
    </source>
    
    `utils.js`
    <source>
    >>> FIND
    // Start the interval
    const intervalId = setInterval(incrementCounter, 1000);
    ===
    // Start the interval
    const intervalId = setInterval(incrementCounter, intervalMilliseconds);
    <<< REPLACE
    </source>

3. Multiple replacements in a single file are allowed.
4. Keep FIND/REPLACE blocks small always ALWAYS including few more lines of context to generate correct replaces and avoid duplicates.
5. NEVER use ** rest of code ** or similar placeholder when replacing file content
6. When mentioning files, always use *full paths*, e.g., `docs/architecture.md`. *always* inside backticks

Inside <thinking> block:
    - Decide about files to work on/with. Only update files inside <output> block.
    - Analyze if new files need to be added to get full context to solve each request

1. Base on overview and guidelines, read key files to fetch context about the user request. Read more important files that are not already read
2. Think step by step in a solution using <thingking> block
3. Give an step by step answer using <output> block
