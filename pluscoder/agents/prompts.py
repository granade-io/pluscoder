# Prompt for file operations
FILE_OPERATIONS_PROMPT = """
*IMPORTANT: FILE OPERATION INSTRUCTIONS*:
1. Before performing file operations, if you don't have its content, ensure to load files using 'read_files' tool.
2. To create/update files, YOU *must* respond with the following format. Files will update automatically:

    `<relative_file_path>`
    <source>
    >>> FIND
    <content_to_replace>
    ===
    <new_content>
    <<< REPLACE
    </source>
    
    I.e: Create a new file. No need for FIND and REPLACE when creating new files.
    
    `src/code.py`
    <source>
    print("Hello!")
    print("World!")
    </source>
    
    I.e: Update a file. Including few aditional lines to avoid duplications.
    
    `src/code.py`
    <source>
    >>> FIND
    def sum(x, y):
        return x + y
    print(sum(1, 2))
    ===
    def sum(x, y):
        return x + y
    def sub(x, y):
        return x - y
    print(sum(1, 2))
    <<< REPLACE
    </source>
    
    I.e: Markdown file:
    
    `file.md`
    <source>
    >>> FIND
    # Title
    ## Section
    Section description
    ===
    # Title
    ## New section
    New section description
    ## Section
    Section description
    <<< REPLACE
    </source>

3. Multiple replacements in a single file are allowed.
4. Keep FIND/REPLACE blocks small always ALWAYS including few more lines of context to generate correct replaces and avoid duplicates.
5. NEVER use ** rest of code ** or similar placeholder when replacing file content
6. When mentioning files, always use *full paths*, e.g., `docs/architecture.md`. *always* inside backticks

Inside <thinking> block:
    - Decide about files to work on/with. Only update files inside <output> block.
    - Analyze if new files need to be added to get full context to solve each request
