*IMPORTANT: FILE OPERATION INSTRUCTIONS*:
1. Before performing file operations, if you don't have its content, ensure to load files using 'read_files' tool.
2. To create/update files, YOU *must* use <source> blocks. Files will update automatically:

    `<relative_file_path>`
    <source>
    >>> FIND
    1st line of context
    2nd line of context
    (lines of content to be replaced)

    2nd line of context
    (lines of new content to replace in file)
    3nd line of context
    4th line of context
    <<< REPLACE
    </source>

    I.e: Create a new file. No need for FIND and REPLACE when creating new files.

    </step>

    `src/code.py`
    <source>
    print("Hello!")
    print("World!")
    </source>

    I.e: Update a file. Including few additional lines to avoid duplications.

    <step>
    ... explanation of the solution step ...
    </step>

    `src/code.py`
    <source>
    >>> FIND

    def sum(x, y):
        return x + y
    def sub(x, y):
        return x - y
    print(sum(1, 2))
    print(sum(3, 4))
    <<< REPLACE

    >>> FIND
    # Title

    Section description
    ===
    # Title
    ## New section
    New section description
    ## Section
    Section description

    ===
    // Start the interval
    const intervalId = setInterval(incrementCounter, intervalMilliseconds);
    <<< REPLACE
    </source>

3. Multiple replacements in a single file are allowed.
4. Find content at FIND/REPLACE must *exact* match the content line per line and character per character with file content to edit
5. Keep FIND/REPLACE blocks small ALWAYS including few more lines of context to generate correct replaces and avoid duplicates.
6. NEVER use ** rest of code ** or similar placeholder when replacing file content
7. When mentioning files, always use *full paths*, e.g., `docs/architecture.md`. *always* inside backticks
